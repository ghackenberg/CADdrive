**CADdrive** (see https://caddrive.org and https://caddrive.com) provides an **open source** solution for **collaborative product design**. In the most recent version our platform supports the following features:

- **Member management** for assigning access permissions on product data to our users (using a role-based access control paradigm),
- **Version management** for tracking the evolution of CAD models (currently in [LDraw format](https://ldraw.org/) or [GLTF format](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/), but extensible to other formats as well),
- **Issue management** for task specification and discussion among stakeholders, as well as assignment to project members, and
- **Milestone management** for scheduling task execution and tracking completion across the design project (using time boxing).

In **issue discussions**, you can refer to parts and assemblies of CAD models through **Markdown references**. The references help making the discussion more self-explanatory and easy to understand.
