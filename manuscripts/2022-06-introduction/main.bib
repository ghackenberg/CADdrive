    abstract = {Machines and plants continuously increase in complexity due to higher customer expectations regarding their purpose and flexibility of use. For this reason, machines and plants development processes need to adapt continuously to the present situation. In addition, the growing meaning of electronic and software components in machines and plants complicates the engineering since the interaction of different disciplines leads to increasing coordination efforts and problems regarding the interface between these disciplines. To face these challenges, the suitable handling of arising requirements is one key factor for the success of engineering processes. Therefore, a multi-disciplinary modeling technique for requirements management is presented in this paper. After a summary of approaches for model-based development and requirements management in the context of mechatronic systems engineering, the modeling technique with its concepts, terms, tasks and workflows is illustrated. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, the modeling technique was applied to a miniaturized packaging plant, which is currently developed at the Institute for Machine Tools and Industrial Management (iwb) of Technische Universität München for teaching students and benchmarking engineering methods and tools. Finally, an outlook with extensions of the concept for fault-tolerant systems and the integration of further engineering tools in order to promote a consistent engineering tool-chain is given.}

    abstract = {Various drivers, especially increasing market dynamics, force industrial enterprises to evolve their production facilities ever more frequently. Analyzing the impact of changed requirements on the production facilities early in the engineering process would facilitate the estimation of resulting costs and therefore reduce project risk. In industrial practice, requirements specifications are typically textual lists and only structured by a table of contents; an analysis of the impact of changes within the requirements specification is extensive, as no documented information is available about how the requirements and other elements of the requirements specification depend on each other. To identify impacts of changes in a requirements specification more efficiently, this paper proposes a model-based approach that classifies the elements of a requirements specification according to their contents and based on the classification preselects automatically candidate elements of the requirements specification that are possibly affected by the change. This paper shows the application of the approach on the manufacturing automation systems domain by means of a pick and place unit (PPU) demonstrator. The technical validation demonstrates that in the example of the PPU the impact analysis is more efficient with a content model than on an unstructured list; the effort for impact analysis is reduced further when adapting the content model to the manufacturing automation systems domain.}

The research approach begins with a literature review in design reuse and requirements management to identify appropriate methods within each domain. A framework is proposed based on the identified requirements. The framework is then demonstrated using a case study example: vacuum pump design. Requirements are presented as a component of the integrated design knowledge framework. The proposed framework enables the application of requirements management as a dynamic process, including capture, analysis and recording of requirements. It takes account of the evolving requirements and the dynamic nature of the interaction between requirements and product structure through the various stages of product development.}

  abstract={To enable Systems Engineering in interdisciplinary teams adequately, suitable software tools are needed to master the complexity of system modeling within the problem-solving process respectively project management. However, since there are many different approaches for Systems Engineering, this paper considers Generic Systems Engineering (GSE) as a generally valid and proven approach. Furthermore, Systems Engineering can be applied to many different objects. For this purpose, the paper focuses on organization systems. This is due to the fact that the increasingly dynamic markets generate new or changing requirements that affect not only the production and development of technical products, but also the business processes in companies. This implicates, for instance, the infrastructure and the interfaces of business processes, the identification of responsible persons respectively roles, and moreover, the traceability of the information flow between persons and IT systems within the business processes. In order to manage the vast complexity of organizational structures in system modeling, the enhanced Demand Compliant Design (e-DeCoDe) approach is considered as an implicit part of Generic Systems Engineering. Hence, in this paper, we analyze, evaluate, and discuss different software tools and examine their suitability to ensure the model-based development of complex organizational systems using the Generic Systems Engineering and enhanced Demand Compliant Design approach.},

abstract = {The crucial factor for a successful usage of modeling approaches of systems engineering is the interaction of language, method, and tool. For this, specific challenges arise for the application of MBSE in agile requirements engineering. From observations in agile development practice at a machine tool manufacturer, the challenges for model-based requirements engineering are described and each is assigned to its critical aspect of modeling: The language must formally represent the requirements data model, especially for planning engineering generations. The tool must support collaborative, interdisciplinary cooperation, and consider the dynamics of the requirements model during the development process. The method must individually support the requirements engineering activities, which are carried out several times in a sprint during the development process and must enable a target-oriented process for bundling the requirements into engineering generations. Taking these demands into account, an approach is then presented providing activity-based views in conjunction with activity steps based on a consistent ontology for the description of product requirements and verification activities. The activity steps are composed in activity patterns and support the user in making use of the views for modeling requirements for the engineering generations. The approach is implemented in the software JIRA at a machine tool manufacturer. The subsequent evaluation shows that the approach is used in development practice and offers the potential to plan engineering generation systematically and comprehensibly and to ensure a regular review of the implemented requirements.}

    abstract = { Nowadays, requirements management (RQM) is mostly not included in the current structures of product lifecycle management (PLM) systems, although RQM has become a critical activity throughout the PLM. Customer requirements with all related product information need not only be integrated with each other, but with all processes and stakeholders involved through the related business functions of product lifecycle. In this paper, we examine the various challenges of RQM, especially related to PLM. Company-specific challenges are identified, when integrating RQM with PLM in a case company acting in the automotive industry. The objective of this study is to find out how product-related information on customer requirements could better be utilised and integrated with PLM. We propose a new integration framework according to which the challenges at different integration levels are categorised. As a final conclusion, the study shows the core points where and how the concepts of PLM and RQM should be developed, as to create requirements integrated solutions for extended products and systems through the lifecycle. }

    abstract = { Large high-technology companies operate in fiercely competitive international markets. To succeed, they need to shorten the cycle time of new product development (NPD) while improving product quality and maintaining or reducing the total resources required. Their abilities to meet these business goals depend on how extensively and effectively they collect, analyze, and utilize requirements in their product development. Creating and sharing such knowledge is complicated partly because the NPD activities of large companies are geographically distributed. Groupware technologies allow knowledge to be created and shared more effectively. Thus, they hold considerable potential as means of meeting the goals. Yet, little theory-based guidance is available to help design groupware-based requirements management systems (RMS) for large geographically distributed organizations. In this article, we draw on existing literature and experiences from large-scale distributed industrial development projects at Nokia to start building a design theory that answers the following question: What are the necessary and sufficient properties of RMS, and how should RMS be designed and introduced in large high-technology companies to best achieve the business goals? The main contributions of the article are (a) the creation of a generic set of requirements for RMS, (b) the development of the RMS design, and (c) the empirical validation of the design by analyzing instantiations of the design at various product lines of Nokia. }

  abstract={Product development processes and best practices have come a long way in the last decade through continuous evolutions of new lifecycle and process models. Development models such as the waterfall model, spiral model, rational unified process, agile and many others have looked at efficiency of the development processes. These approaches have helped practitioners improve immensely on the efficiency and efficacy of the product development processes. However, product quality needs to be measured by parameters that go beyond the traditional criteria like performance, reliability, reusability etc. A product that has any interaction with the end user also needs to meet a fundamental requirement of being “user friendly”. Development models such as JAD (Joint Application Development) have focused on making products user friendly. Apart from achieving the technical soundness in a product, the success of the product also largely depends on how well the product addresses the primary requirements of the user such as desirability, relevance and usability. Not meeting these requirements leads to bad user experience, which, in turn can actually lead to failure of the product. This paper discusses some of the misconceptions and myths that exist in the industry regarding Requirements Engineering (RE) and User Experience Design (UXD), and how user needs typically slip through the cracks under the name of “non functional requirements”. The paper highlights the need for RE and UXD focus during the overall product development life cycle. In the concluding section an integrated framework for RE and UXD in the PLM process is presented.},

The proposed visualizations allow the stakeholder to get an overview of the overall project status, as well as detailed information. Recommendations for methods based on this information can be derived.}
