\section{Tool design}
\label{sec:contribution}

As explained previously, our tool design comprises three models: An integrated \textbf{data model}, a \textbf{permission model}, and an \textbf{interface model}.
The integrated data model describes our representation of stakeholders, roles, CAD model revisions, design tasks, and project schedules.
The permission model explains which changes the individual stakeholders can perform on top of the data model depending on his/her role.
Finally, the interface model demonstrates how the previous models can be put into action practically.
