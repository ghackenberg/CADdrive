\begin{abstract}
    Product development is facing new challenges as a result of the demand for increasingly individualized products in small batch sizes and short time to markets. 
    By providing software tools, digitalization is an enabler for agile product development. Stakeholders such as the customer, the project manager, the requirement engineer and the product designer can develop the product together and react quickly to each other's demands.
    Today, each stakeholder uses its own platform to manage work results like product designs, requirements or associated tasks.
    This complicates aspects such as scheduling, priority planning or the definition of new requirements as there is no common basis of information.
    To solve these issues, we have developed an open source platform on which all relevant results can be managed.
    Our platform combines project management, requirements engineering and offers the possibility to upload 3D CAD models to provide a transparent insight into the progress of product development. 
    The focus was on making the software lightweight and intuitive to use. 
    This article describes the development of such a platform and evaluates its benefits, drawbacks and what lessons we have learned.

\section{Introduction}
    \label{sec:introduction}
    \subsection*{Context}
    The trend is for products to become increasingly complex and have shorter time to markets. ~\cite{Ahti2005}.
    Customer wishes are becoming more and more individual and often cannot be fully expressed at the beginning due to the complexity of some products.
    Clear requirements and a focus on the end user with management support represent half of the success of future product development~\cite{6226784}.
    To meet these challenges, agile methods are introduced into the development process which are leading to more speed, efficiency and influences the quality of the products~\cite{ozkan2019agile}. 
    The majority of agile approaches come from software development~\cite{HEIMICKE2021786}.
    For software development, there are already some platforms, such as GitHub\footnote{https://www.github.com/}, that make it possible to define requirements, manage tasks and communicate with other stakeholders.
    Due to the complexity, dynamics and uncertainty involved in the development of mechanical products, the tools of software development cannot be applied that easily~\cite{HEIMICKE2021786}.
    There are also suitable software solutions for the development of mechanical products. However, most of these tools are specialized for a specific task and very few tools offer a multifunctional solution.~\cite{MarionTucker}. 
    So, for the development of mechanical products, many different software tools are used, which cover the particular area of application, such as project management, requirements engineering or product design.
    Because of the number of different tools used to develop products, isolated artifacts are generated, which makes collaborative product development very difficult ~\cite{houshmand2010collaborative}.
    Merging the data from separate applications becomes a major challenge because they do not have a common database. This leads to differences in terminology and concepts, which causes communication problems~\cite{Jorma2014}.
    Many projects are very expensive because there is no platform that provides clean communication and an integrated data model with a transparent view of the data. 
    
    \subsection*{Problem}
    Typically, project managers, requirements engineers, and product designers work with different tools that do not have a consistent and integrated database.
    Due to this inconsistency in data models, project plans, requirements, change requests, and the CAD models are isolated from each other.
    The more complex a project becomes, the harder it is to keep track of it, which causes finding information to take a long time or information to be overlooked entirely.  
    As a result, problems with communication and decision making occur, resulting in unnecessary product development costs due to unnecessary iterations.

    \subsection*{Solution}
    We take an integrated view of time management, task management and version management. In this case this article describes the implementation and of such a software and provide an evaluation of our findings.
    The software considers product development as an overall concept. This gives the stakeholders a transparent and traceable overview of the project progress and enables agile product development.
    On our platform, users can create different products. For each product, members, versions, issues and milestones can then be added and edited. Each version of the product contains a 3D CAD model that can be viewed like in a 3D CAD software. Members can be registered for a product which possess different permissions. 
    With the help of the customer member role, the customer can participate in agile project management.
    He is able to track the current status of product development, create tasks and discuss them.
    Issues are part of the requirements management and milestones form the core concept for project management.
    Milestones are filled with issues that can be open or closed. A milestone is considered complete when all associated issues are closed.
    To provide a connection between requirements management and the model revisions, parts of the 3D model can be marked and referenced in from within issues.
    Each issue contains a communication channel where the respective requirement can be discussed. This allows the customer to be involved in the process and to clarify questions at an early stages.

    \subsection*{Outline}
    This article is structured as follows:
    In Section~\ref{sec:differentiation} we discuss related work on the problem defined previously.
    In Section~\ref{sec:contribution} we present our original solution to the problem at hand.
    Then, in Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} we evaluate our solution with respect to different criteria.
    Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} we summarize our learnings and provide an outlook on future work.
    
    \section{Related work}

    \subsection*{Scientific approaches}
    Google Scholar was used to search for appropriate literature using the following search terms in various combinations: Requirements Engineering, requirements management, computer aided design, product development, mechanical engineering, mechanical design, industrial design, traceability, integration, product lifecycle management, software tools, agile project management, new product development, collaboration, collaborative information technology. For each combination searched, the first 30 entries were looked through, and the most relevant articles were used as state-of-the-art references. 
    
    Most of the articles focus on requirement management and describe its theoretical aspects. These articles also point out the importance of well-executed requirement management and the challenges that occur in the process. It is mentioned again and again that requirement engineering is a major part of success.
    We found an article that divides requirement management into subcategories and phases, describing each aspect of developing new products in a high-tech company~\cite{Ahti2005}.
    In product development, it is important to be able to reuse the knowledge generated. One article described a framework for combining requirements management with engineering design and making it reusable. The resulting design reuse system consists of three key elements: process knowledge, task knowledge and product knowledge~\cite{BAXTER2008585}.
    An article provides a scenario based approach for the identification, elaboration and specification of engineering design requirements using a three-phase model~\cite{liu2012scenario}.
    Another article provides a literature review to show how requirements engineering can be further enhanced with the help of guidelines for requirement management process improvement~\cite{Kauppinen2005}.
    Computer aided software engineering tools help to support the development process. In one article such a CASE tool was developed as an Eclipse plugin which enables traceability and accessibility from the planning to the coding phase. This work focuses on the development of software products~\cite{6976693}.
    A survey evaluated the use of individual practices and cooperation activities for new product development depending on firm size and complexity of the products~\cite{sanchez2003flexibility}.
    An article shows the importance for requirements engineering to use visualization tools to help stakeholders catch data. They describe different elements for visualization and want to implement a software tool based on their results later~\cite{RICHTER2020271}.
    An article points out what methods and tools are important for combining requirements engineering with project management and how important it is to see the two fields as an overall concept. The challenges of requirements engineering and project management in different contexts are highlighted. A framework is developed that combines requirements management and project management to increase the quality and effectiveness of multidomain development processes. The integration of CAD data is not covered~\cite{Jorma2014}.
    Another contribution is the implementation of a tool for model based requirement engineering for agile product development. The concept of the tool is to connect the product requirement with the development task and the corresponding test case. Based on this a dashboard was built which received positive feedback and will be further developed~\cite{WINDISCH2022550}.
    One paper deals with concepts for concurrent new product development to implement agile manufacturing. The most important tools and concepts are presented and discussed in how far they enable agile manufacturing~\cite{buyukozkan2004survey}.
    A tool was built using web development tools such as Angular.js and Node.js to support product development. The tool supports the business, operational and technical aspects for service-oriented software~\cite{belfadel2022requirements}.
    Another paper compared different software tools for enhanced demand compliant design based on different criteria. The analysis shows how important it is to use the right tool and that most tools focus only on the own discipline and rather a universal and transdisciplinary approach should be chosen~\cite{9447081}.
    We have found a study that provides empirical evidence that tools for new product development have a positive impact on efficiency. They suggest three measures of effectiveness: innovativeness, new product quality and market performance. most tools do not cover all three aspects, as they are often very specific to one use case~\cite{DURMUSOGLU2011321}.
    An article presents a framework to improve cross-functional collaboration in a new product development process. They emphasize that innovative and structural mechanisms increase the level of integration and effective management~\cite{Jassawalla}.
    In one article, the importance of requirement engineering is discussed and attention is drawn to the fact that most studies and research work that is available has many strategies but no real implementation~\cite{kumar2022requirements}.
    A paper compared two projects were compared with each other to evaluate the impact of collaborative information technology tools. Project A used software for communication, tasks and data storage. Project B divided these parts among three tools and experienced significant delays and cost overruns. The manager of project A noted the benefit of a single place for communication and product iteration~\cite{marion_fixson_2019}.

    \subsection*{Commercial approaches}
    \subsubsection*{GitHub}
    It is a service for project management of software projects. Repositories are created and managed here. Multiple project versions can be uploaded to the repository and requirements can be collected, divided into milestones and discussed in the issues section. These functionalities solve some problems defined above. However, GitHub is only designed for software products and does not support CAD files. Thus, solution engineering of mechanical systems cannot be included. We find GitHub to be an excellent platform for software development and in the course of this article we want to create a platform that offers similar tools, but is suitable for 3D CAD models.

    \subsubsection*{Onshape\footnote{https://www.onshape.com/}}
    The tool onshape is a premium software, from the company PTC, which combines product development, the CAD, data management, collaboration and real-time analysis. The tool offers a huge range of features. It provides a secure cloud workspace for all project stakeholders and the development team can work together on the design of the product. The tool enables multiple parallel design iterations and real-time collaborative work, and offers many more features. 
    Unfortunately, the software also has disadvantages compared to lightweight open source software due to the huge scope of functions and the binding to one company. If the customer is involved in an agile project development process, he has a high entry hurdle when learning the program.  In order to keep the tool consistent with real project progress, it must be constantly updated. Due to the high amount of data in the tool, the stakeholders and especially the customer can lose the overview. For the customer, it is easier to see exports of product versions than the entire system when making decisions, and the company does not have to disclose design details. The deep integration of Onshape into the world of PTC forces you to be caught in it. 
    Here we want to go the approach of an open source software that works with 3D CAD exports. Furthermore, the software should be intuitive to use and easy to learn. Because the entire solution engineering process does not take place in our tool, but only exports are uploaded, there is also freedom with which data the platform is fed and what the customer gets to see. The customer should be able to participate in the product development on the basis of the product versions provided without having to see complex design details.

    \subsection*{Conclusion}
    Most of the papers we have found through research highlight the area of requirements engineering in particular or provide concepts for new product development. They provide many theoretical concepts to point out the importance, challenges and methods for improvement. 
    Only a few articles describe a concrete implementation, but these only cover requirements engineering and project management or a combination of these two disciplines. None of these solutions included the possibility to additionally integrate CAD data to cover the entire product development process. The two commercial solutions GitHub and Onshape are excellent tools in their own domain but in our opinion are not suitable to support the agile product development process with close customer collaboration because of various reasons. 
    In the case of GitHub, it's because it doesn't support design drawings. 
    Oneshape software is an expert tool that delivers a huge feature set and discloses confidential enineering data. Customer and other stakeholders can easily lose track by access all the design details of the product. After our research we came to the conclusion that there is a need for a lightweight software tool that covers requirement engineering, project management and offers the possibility to integrate 3D CAD models. This field of research is new and important and the market is by far not yet saturated with tools that provide support for product development.
