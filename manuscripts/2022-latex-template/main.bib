    abstract = {Machines and plants continuously increase in complexity due to higher customer expectations regarding their purpose and flexibility of use. For this reason, machines and plants development processes need to adapt continuously to the present situation. In addition, the growing meaning of electronic and software components in machines and plants complicates the engineering since the interaction of different disciplines leads to increasing coordination efforts and problems regarding the interface between these disciplines. To face these challenges, the suitable handling of arising requirements is one key factor for the success of engineering processes. Therefore, a multi-disciplinary modeling technique for requirements management is presented in this paper. After a summary of approaches for model-based development and requirements management in the context of mechatronic systems engineering, the modeling technique with its concepts, terms, tasks and workflows is illustrated. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, the modeling technique was applied to a miniaturized packaging plant, which is currently developed at the Institute for Machine Tools and Industrial Management (iwb) of Technische Universit채t M체nchen for teaching students and benchmarking engineering methods and tools. Finally, an outlook with extensions of the concept for fault-tolerant systems and the integration of further engineering tools in order to promote a consistent engineering tool-chain is given.}

    abstract = {Various drivers, especially increasing market dynamics, force industrial enterprises to evolve their production facilities ever more frequently. Analyzing the impact of changed requirements on the production facilities early in the engineering process would facilitate the estimation of resulting costs and therefore reduce project risk. In industrial practice, requirements specifications are typically textual lists and only structured by a table of contents; an analysis of the impact of changes within the requirements specification is extensive, as no documented information is available about how the requirements and other elements of the requirements specification depend on each other. To identify impacts of changes in a requirements specification more efficiently, this paper proposes a model-based approach that classifies the elements of a requirements specification according to their contents and based on the classification preselects automatically candidate elements of the requirements specification that are possibly affected by the change. This paper shows the application of the approach on the manufacturing automation systems domain by means of a pick and place unit (PPU) demonstrator. The technical validation demonstrates that in the example of the PPU the impact analysis is more efficient with a content model than on an unstructured list; the effort for impact analysis is reduced further when adapting the content model to the manufacturing automation systems domain.}
