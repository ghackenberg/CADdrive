\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this article, we summarized our progress on translating the ideas of GitHub to the domain of product development.
Therefore, we first developed an integrated data model for requirement (or design tasks), project schedules, and CAD model revisions.
Most importantly, we realized the integration between requirements and CAD model revisions with Markdown syntax, which proved suitable.
Furthermore, we developed an interface model, through which product versions can be uploaded as well as issues and milestones can be managed.
The interface model is tightly aligned with GitHub, but we made substantial changes in the revision graph and the issue view to incorporate interactive 3D models.
In the next step, we plan -- besides others -- to conduct user tests and extend the requirement management capabilities.
