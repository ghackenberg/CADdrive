\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

With today's shift from a seller's to a buyer's market, there is a clear trend towards product customization. 
Customers are constantly seeking products that cater to their specific needs and budgets. 
However, creating customer-specific designs can often be inefficient and costly, making it unaffordable for the average consumer.
Besides, in most industries very few or practically no systems are created “from scratch”, so engineers are likely to reuse knowledge from a previous project or product in the form of documents, processes, or models~\cite{Góngora_2015}. 

To find a balance between reuse and customization in software and systems development, software product line engineering (SPLE) has emerged as a viable solution. 
SPLE is an approach to cost-efficiently deriving tailored products for markets and customers, utilizing common components and services in a planned manner~\cite{Runeson_2012}.
The focus is shifted from building isolated products to building families of related products, while reuse is discussed not at an individual object level, e.g.~libraries or components, but as a whole: organizational, process-wise, and also lifecycle-wise end-to-end from requirements to actually deployed variability at the customer~\cite{Schwanninger_2009}. 
This approach involves the development of a core platform as well as reusable components that can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of different products within a product line. 

For example, software products that are being developed for the international market must be adapted for different legal or cultural environments, as well as for different languages, and so must provide adapted user interfaces~\cite{Beuche_2007}. 
To increase software reuse and streamline development processes, developers create a modular software framework that includes common functionalities. 
The framework modules then can be reused across different product models and customized as needed to meet specific requirements for each individual market and customer.

SPLE principles have now spread far beyond the software domain. Companies in many other industries, such as automotive, aerospace, and consumer electronics are taking advantage of reusability and variability management while reducing time-to-market, improving efficiency, and increasing customer satisfaction. 
For instance, Lockheed Martin estimates that because of its SPLE-inspired approach it saves over \$47 million a year ~\cite{Gregg_2015}, while Hewlett-Packard reports that it builds products 10 times as complex, with 1/4 of the staff, in 1/3 of the time, and with 1/25 of the bugs of previous products ~\cite{Mebane_2007}.

However, when it comes to incorporating SPLE principles into the creation of technical systems, particularly when creating geometric representations of product lines of mechanical products, this approach has not yet become widely established. 

\paragraph{Research objective}

To overcome the current situation we work on translating established ideas and concepts from the software product line engineering community to the development of physical (and ultimately cyber-physical) products.
Also, we want to help improving and more widely establishing product line engineering education for designers of physical products.

\paragraph{Research question}

To reach our research objective, we tackle the following research questions here:
How can digital LEGO be applied to create meaningful use cases for PLE education in physical product design?
What challenges arise in managing module compatibility and variability when applying PLE principles to digital LEGO models?
To what extent do existing digital LEGO tool support the modeling and validation of PLE concepts and where are the gaps?

\paragraph{Contribution}

To answer these research questions, we first conduct a literature review on product line engineering in the software domain as well as other domains (see Section~\ref{sec:related-work}).
And then, based on the results of our literature review we derive a digital LEGO case study consisting of atomic modules, various configuration options, and a 150\% model (see Section~\ref{sec:case-study}).

\section{Related work}
\label{sec:related-work}

Subsequently, we first summarize the relevant state-of-the-art of product line engineering (PLE).
First, we describe common principles and methodologies in the field of PLE in Section~\ref{sec:principles}.
Then, we explain the concept of modules and non-contact as well as contact-based mechanical interfaces in Section~\ref{sec:modules}.
Finally, we explore the representation of the product line and its individual variants in Section~\ref{sec:variants}.

To conduct a comprehensive literature review on SPLE, we employed a structured search strategy. 
The primary keywords included: "Software Product Line Engineering", "Product Line Engineering", "Variability Management", "Feature Modeling", “LEGO”, "Interface", "Modularity", "Domain Engineering" and "Software Reuse". 
The search was performed in Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library and SPLE conference proceedings. 
The search combined the terms using Boolean logic to refine results. 
For example, in Google Scholar, the following query was used: ("Software Product Line Engineering" OR "Product Line Engineering") AND ("Variability Management" OR "Feature Model" OR "Modularity" OR "Domain Engineering"). 
Only English-language publications were considered. 
SPLC conference was scanned manually to identify relevant papers that might have been missed in database searches. 
Additionally, technical reports, theses, and industry whitepapers were considered to capture practical insights. 
The references of selected papers were reviewed to find foundational works, citations were tracked to discover newer research building on key studies. 
Based on their relevance to SPLE methodologies, variability management, and modularity, 26 papers were selected from a large pool (around 1000 papers).


\subsection{Principles and methodologies}
\label{sec:principles}

A product line can be seen as a set of individual products that share a common, managed set of features addressing the specific needs of particular market segments or missions and that are derived from a common set of core assets in a systematic way~\cite{Clements_2002}.
In this context, a feature denotes a characteristic of a member product in a product line that distinguishes it from other member products in the product line~\cite{ISO/IEC_26550}.
Van der Linden et al.~\cite{Linden_2007} formulated several principles that are fundamental in PLE including, among others, the principle of the two-lifecycle approach, which comprises the domain engineering and the application engineering lifecycle, and the principle of variability management.

Domain engineering is a reuse-based approach defining the scope (i.e., domain definition), specifying the structure (i.e., domain architecture), and building the assets for a class of systems, subsystems, or member products~\cite{ISO/IEC_26550}.
During domain analysis, developers determine the scope of the product line and identify its common and variable features, which they then document in a variability model. 
A number of techniques have been developed to manage variability.
For our case study, we use the orthogonal variability model (OVM) introduced by Pohl et al.~\cite{Pohl_2005}, which uses variants and variation points to denote variability, and dependencies to define relationships between variants and variation points.

In contrast, application engineering represents the process of deriving a single product variant that is tailored to the requirements of a specific customer, based on the results of domain engineering~\cite{Kästner_2013}. 
Note that with the appearance of second-generation PLE, the importance of the application engineering process steadily decreases, while products are derived through the use of high-end industrial-strength automation that configures the shared assets appropriately for each product~\cite{Krueger_2013}.

\subsection{Modules and interfaces}
\label{sec:modules}

Next, it is worth mentioning that PLE often goes hand in hand with the concept of modularity.
While modularity enables the configuration of multiple end products from a limited number of modules, PLE manages and optimizes a company's product diversity in order to control complexity and to balance out too many variants and versions.
Li et al.~\cite{Li_2019} explain modularity as a systematic approach where a product or system is composed of various modules, and these modules can be combined in different ways to form different products with individual characteristics.

However, clear rules should be defined to reassure that all subsystems will be compatible and function correctly in the final design~\cite{Baldwin_2003}.
Such rules concern, among other things, the syntactic and semantic module interfaces, which define how the modules can be connected and interact.
The effects of a misspecified interface can go beyond module incompatibility to unexpected product behavior~\cite{Parslov_2015}. 
In their course on software product lines, Kuiter et al.~\cite{Kuiter_2025} highlight how modular systems with clearly defined interfaces can be effectively used for modelling variability. 
They demonstrate it by using as a tangible example LEGO minifigures.  

When applying PLE principles to the development of physical products, it is important to consider the physical nature of module interfaces.
Ulrich ~\cite{Ulrich_1995} states, that interfaces may involve mechanical, contact-based interactions between components in addition to non-contact interactions.
Such contact-based interactions usually entail constraints on the contact points of the mechanical surfaces to guarantee the required function of the assembly.
By specifying these constraints in computer-aided design (CAD) models, designers can ensure the proper arrangement and compatibility of parts within the products of the product line.

Warniez et al.~\cite{Warniez_2014} emphasize that early integration of geometric specifications is critical to avoid late-stage design conflicts and propose to formalize geometric constraints via SysML profiles. 
Yet, this approach lacks a direct connection to physical prototyping, making it challenging to validate real-world assemblability.
Koch et al.~\cite{Koch_2016} highlight the role of geometric constraints in ensuring compatibility and propose integrating CAD models with feature models to manage geometric dependencies. 
However, it requires specialized CAD toolchains, limiting accessibility for education or early-stage design. 
Our work bridges this gap by using digital LEGO as a low-fidelity alternative for early spatial validation (like SysML) but with precise geometry (unlike abstract SysML volumes).


\subsection{Variants and representations}
\label{sec:variants}

The digital representations of the individual products in a product line can include, but are not limited to, requirement and design specifications, system and computer-aided design (CAD) models, source code and build files, test plans and cases, user documentation, repair manuals and installation guides, project budgets, schedules and work plans, product calibration and configuration files, data models, parts lists, and more~\cite{Clements_2015}. 

A wide-spread technique for the digital representation of product lines and their product variants are so-called 150\% models~\cite{Clements_2015}.
Such models combine all relevant features and characteristics of all product variants of the product line into a common superset model.
Furthermore, such models include all possible configurations of features and characteristics for all the variants and, hence, provide a complete picture of the product line.

Such superset representations of products lines and their variants have been applied successfully not only to software systems, but also to cyber-physical production systems and their various interdisciplinary subsystems~\cite{Fadhlillah_2023}, digital twins of physical products with advanced simulation capabilities~\cite{Wagner_2024}, and assembly instructions for configurable physical products~\cite{Zogopoulos_2024}.

\section{Case study}
\label{sec:case-study}

In this third section we introduce the case study, which we prepared for testing the applicability of digital LEGO based on the open LDraw\footnote{\url{https://ldraw.org}} data format and parts library for product line engineering education in a physical product design context.
The study draws inspiration from established SPL practices in drone software~\cite{Steiner_2014}, adapting variability modeling techniques to a physical drone product line. 
Unlike Simulink-based approaches, we use digital LEGO to visualize constraints, enabling student experimentation, rapid prototyping and immediate feedback.

The case study was developed using a design science methodology, following three iterative phases:

•	Problem identification: Addressed gaps in teaching PLE for physical systems (e.g., lack of spatial constraint modeling tools).

•	Artifact design: Built a modular drone product line using LDraw’s hierarchical assemblies to encode interfaces and constraints.

•	Validation: Evaluated through pedagogical alignment with the framework of Kuiter et al.~\cite{Kuiter_2025} and mechanical feasibility checks.

Our key design decision was to focus on FPV drones for their modular design and clear performance trade-offs, breaking them down into key components that we adapted into LDraw-compatible modules. 
The study's validity metrics include three FPV drone variants (ultralight, freestyle, and long-range) with distinct performance characteristics, ten modular components, four spatial constraints, and a complete 150\% LDraw model representation.

    \caption{Overview of the atomic (mechatronic) modules for the drone use case.}
    \label{fig:atomic-modules}
\end{figure*}


We first provide an overview of the atomic (mechatronic) modules of the product line, from which the individual variants can been assembled in Section~\ref{sec:atomic-modules}.
Then, we introduce the interfaces between the individual modules and possible interface constraints in Section~\ref{sec:interfaces}.
Thereafter, we explain the configuration options of the drone use case in the form of an orthogonal variability model (OVM) in Section~\ref{sec:configuration-options}.
And finally, we introduce the 150\% LDraw (or digital LEGO) model for the drone use case including all atomic modules as well as the assembly structures of the three different drone variants in Section~\ref{sec:150-model}.

\subsection{Atomic modules}
\label{sec:atomic-modules}

The atomic modules of our drone product line case are shown in \cref{fig:atomic-modules} and include propellers, batteries, frames, and covers each adding required system functionality and coming in different sizes with different physical and performance characteristics.
In the following, we explain each class of atomic module as well as their functionality in the context of the drone use case and the available sizes in more detail.

\subsubsection*{Propellers}
\label{sec:propellers}

The propellers (see \cref{fig:propellor-small}, \cref{fig:propellor-medium}, and \cref{fig:propellor-large}) generate thrust by spinning rapidly, allowing a drone to move in all directions. 
The small and large two-blade propellers provide better efficiency and longer flight times, while the medium triblade propeller offers more stability and maneuverability. 
Also note that in general smaller propellers provide better agility, while bigger ones provide more thrust and efficiency, allowing the drone fly longer distances.
On the contrary, larger propellers also require more power to spin.

\subsubsection*{Batteries}
\label{sec:batteries}

The batteries (see \cref{fig:battery-small}, \cref{fig:battery-medium}, and \cref{fig:battery-large}) provide power for the drone and its equipment to operate. 
The smaller capacity batteries are lighter and more compact, which can improve the agility and maneuverability of the drone and typically comes with lower material, production, and shipping costs.
However, smaller batteries typically also have shorter flight times, which means that for longer flights a higher capacity battery is required, which potentially can power additional equipment, but usually also comes with higher costs.

\subsubsection*{Frames}
\label{sec:frames}

The frames (see \cref{fig:frame-small} and \cref{fig:frame-large}), which in our case study implicitly include the legs and the motors, serve as the mechanical structures that hold the previous components (i.e.\ propellers and batteries) together.
The small frame is more maneuverable and agile due to its lower weight and air resistance, and tpyically can be shipped at lower costs.
In contrast, the large frame offers more space for additional components such as the larger batteries and possibly other equipment typically mounted on drones (e.g.\ cameras and infrared sensors).

\subsubsection*{Covers}
\label{sec:covers}

The covers (see \cref{fig:cover-small} and \cref{fig:cover-large}) mainly protect the internal components of the drone (i.e.\ batteries and possibly other equipment) from external influences such as humidity.
Furthermore, the covers improve the aerodynamic efficiency of the drone due to smoothening the drone surface.
In alignment with the previous two frame sizes, the covers come in a small and a large size as well.
The small size fits onto the small frame and typically can be produced and shipped at lower costs, while the large size fits onto the large frame and, hence, supports larger equipment.

\subsection{Module interfaces}
\label{sec:interfaces}

Next, we discuss the interfaces between the modules from the previous section.
As stated before, the frame modules are responsible for holding the other modules together.
Consequently, the frame modules interfaces with all the other modules, while the other modules do not interface with each other directly.
In the following, we primarily describe the mechanical interfaces between the modules, but also highlight potential electrical and digital interfaces.

\subsubsection*{Frame-propeller interface}

Both, the small and the large frame, provide standardized mechanical connectors for the propellers.
These connectors are mounted onto the motors, which are implicitly included in the frames here.
In principle, due to the standard connector geometry each propeller size (i.e.\ small, medium, and large) can be mounted onto each frame size (i.e.\ small and large).
However, when mounting large propellers onto small frames, the propellers collide with these frames in certain rotational angles and, hence, yield undesirable system states.

\subsubsection*{Frame-battery interface}

Again, the small and the large frames provide a standard interface for batteries represented by a standard sized hole in our digital LEGO models.
Furthermore, all battery sizes (i.e.\ small, medium, and large) are compatible with this standard hole size.
However, only the large frame can hold all battery sizes, while the small frame can only hold the small and the medium battery size due to space limitations.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that in reality the frame-battery interface might include electrical pins for connecting batteries to motors and more via wires.

\subsubsection*{Frame-cover interface}

\begin{figure*}[tbp]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./FeatureTreeWithLegend3.jpg}
    \caption{Orthogonal varialibility model consisting of one root and four child variation points, and the variants.}
    \label{fig:feature-tree}
\end{figure*}

Finally, the small and the large frames also provide an interface for the small and the large cover represented by studs of certain LEGO bricks.
Here, the small cover only fits onto the small frame, which can be verified through checking the stud connections after mounting.
In contrast, the small cover does not fit onto the large frame, because certain studs remain unconnected after mounting.
Similarly, the large cover only fits onto the large frame, while not fitting the connector interface of the small frame as required.

\subsection{Product configurations}
\label{sec:configuration-options}

As stated before, the atomic modules from Section~\ref{sec:atomic-modules} can be assembled according to the interfaces from Section~\ref{sec:interfaces} to build customized end products with various different performance characteristics.
However, not all combinations of atomic modules are feasible due to geometric and functional constraints.
We describe the set of feasible configurations for our drone case study in the form of an orthogonal variabilty model (OVM) in \cref{fig:feature-tree}.

At its root, the OVM defines a variability point for the entire drone, which includes four mandatory variability dependencies (solid black lines).
These four mandatory variability dependencies point to four independent variability points for the propeller, the battery, the frame, and the cover, which all must be present in a feasible product configuration.
Each of these four variability points finally includes between two and three alternative variability dependencies (dashed black lines).
The alternative variability dependencies of the propeller, the battery, the frame, and the cover variability points finally reference the small, medium, and large propellor modules, the small, medium, and large battery modules, the small and large frame modules, as well as the small and large cover modules, from which one and only one must be present per variability point in a feasible product configuration.

Furthermore, the OVM includes so-called \textit{requires} and \textit{excludes} constraint dependencies for modeling the relationships between the atomic modules (dashed red and blue arrows).
The \textit{requires} constraint dependencies state that the small frame together with the large propeller and/or the large battery do not form a feasible product configuration.
Also, the \textit{excludes} constraint dependencies state that the small frame only together with the small cover, and the large frame only together with the large cover form a feasible product configuration.
Note that in our drone case the constraint dependencies encode the (in-)compatibilities of atomic modules due to their spatial properties.
In the following, we distinguish static and dynamic space constraints:

\begin{figure*}[tbp]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./150_MODEL.png}
    \caption{Superset LDraw model consisting of one main model with three submodels and the atomic modules.}
    \label{fig:150-model}
\end{figure*}

\subsubsection*{Static space constraint}

Static space constraints concern the static (i.e.\ invariant) spatial properties of modules.
In our drone case, this type of constraint applies to the frames and their covers, where only the small frame is compatible with the small cover and the large frame with the large cover due to the relative location of the studs.
Furthermore, this type of constraint applies to the frames and the batteries, where only the small and the medium batteries are compabile with the small frame, but not the large battery due to space limitations.

\subsubsection*{Dynamic space constraint}

Dynamic space constraints concern the dynamic (i.e.\ variable) spatial proeprties of modules.
In our drone case, this type of constraint applies to the small frame and the large propellers.
In general, also the large propellers can be mounted into small frames due to standard connector geometries.
Also, in certain rotational angles, the large propellers do not collide with the small frame.
However, during drone operateion other rotational angles are possible, while cause such collisions, impair system functionality, and potentially cause damage.

\subsection{Model representations}
\label{sec:150-model}

Finally, we consider the practical representation of the drone product line as 150\% model using the LDraw data format and parts library.
The LDraw data format represents digital LEGO models as hierarchical (i.e.\ tree) structures with reusable assemblies as root and internal nodes, and bricks as leaf nodes.
Furthermore, the root node defines a world coordinate system, while the child nodes down to the leaf nodes define their local coordinate systems, which are relative to their parent coordinate systems.
Consequently, the digital LEGO bricks (i.e.\ the leaf nodes) as well as assemblies (i.e.\ the internal nodes) can be positioned and oriented within the local coordinate system of their parent assembly node.

Based on the capabilities of the LDraw data format, we developed a 150\% model for the drone product line case, which is shown in \cref{fig:150-model}.
The root node of the 150\% LDraw model (i.e.\ the \textit{main model}) instantiates the assemblies of the three product configurations (i.e.\ the ultralight, the freestyle, and the long-range drone).
Each product configuration assembly (i.e.\ \textit{submodel}) instantiates four propeller assemblies, one battery assembly, one frame assembly, and one cover assembly and defines their desired positions and orientations.
Finally, the propeller, battery, frame, and cover assemblies (i.e.\ \textit{module}) instantiate the desired bricks and, again, define their desired position and orientation.

Now, when changing the atomic module assembly (i.e.\ adding, moving, removing digital LEGO bricks), these changes are reflected automatically in each product configuration assembly.
Obviously such changes to atomic module assembly can have undesired consequences, especially when changing the spatial properties at their interfaces.
Such changes can introduce incompatibilities between previously compatible modules, or make previously incompatible modules suddenly compatible.
Due to representation of the product line the 150\% LDraw model, the changes are visible instantaneously in each product configuration and, therefore, can be validated quickly.
Also, automatic validation of spatial constraints can be implemented on top of this infrastructure, but are not implemented in current LDraw modeling tools.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The knowledge acquired from the literature review coupled with the case study have provided a comprehensive demonstration of how PLE principles can be effectively applied to the development of physical products with the usage of digital LEGO. 
The first step in our study was to create atomic modules, which could then be assembled into individual variants. 
Then, we derived a robust orthogonal variability model (OVM) as well as a comprehensive 150\% LDraw model representing feasible product configurations. 
By utilizing these methodologies, we were able to derive a product line comprising three distinct drone configuration with several spatial constraint dependencies among the atomic modules.

In the next steps, we plan to explore geometric interfaces between components of physical products in a product line. Unlike software engineering, the realm of interfacing in this context remains relatively uncharted, making it an interesting area for exploration. 
One aspect to consider is the impact of a change to a single module on the entire product line. 
By examining whether such changes are consistent across all products in the line, we can gain insight into issues related to interface compatibility and other mechanical properties. 
The use of digital LEGO is a very promising way to explore this area in an easy way.

Also, to promote PLE education in fields other than computer science, we plan to integrate dedicated PLE tooling for digital LEGO into an open platform for product design~\cite{Hackenberg_2023}, which has been used successfully in the past for product design and systems engineering education at high school and university level~\cite{Hackenberg_2025}.
