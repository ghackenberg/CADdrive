\section{Related work}
\label{sec:related-work}

The research begins by conducting a literature review on various topics. 
Firstly, the review focuses on modularity, followed by an exploration of product line engineering.

\subsection{Modularity}
\label{sec:modualarity}

Li et al. explains modularity as a systematic process where a product or system is composed of various modules, and these modules can be combined in different ways which become different products. 
However, clear rules should be set up to reassure that all subsystems will fit and function together in the final design.
The rules are referred among other things to the module interfaces which define how the interacting modules are connected.
Interfaces may involve geometric connections between two components or may involve non-contact interactions. An interface specification defines the mating geometry in cases where there is a geometric connection.
A connection provides a constraint condition at the contact point of the mechanical unit to guarantee the required function of the composition of parts.
Constraints limit the range of possible solutions.
Overall, the interfaces determine the possible configurations, flexibility in use, and number of variants. 

Although modularity enables the production of  multiple end products from a limited number of building blocks, a company's product diversity should be managed and optimised to control complexity and balance too many versions. 
It is imperative to clearly depict the product hierarchy encompassing all variant components and provide mechanisms for the creation and removal of variants. 
These challenges are addressed by product line engineering through the consolidation of engineering assets and variants.
\subsection{Product line engineering}
\label{sec:product line engineering}

Originating from the software development field, product line engineering is extensively applied in various industries including aerospace, defense, automotive, medical, consumer electronics, energy and telecommunications for the creation of products and systems. 
It is a product development method that defines a procedure for developing product lines. 

Product line is a set of products and/or services sharing explicitly defined and managed common and variable features and relying on the same domain architecture to meet the common and variable needs of specific markets.
A concrete product of a product line is called a product variant.

Van der Linden formulated several principles that are fundamental in product line engineering. They include a two-life-cycle approach, which includes the domain engineering and the application engineering lifecycle.

Domain engineering a reuse-based approach to defining the scope (i.e., domain definition), specifying the structure (i.e., domain architecture), and building the assets (e.g. requirements, designs, software code, documentation) for a class of systems, subsystems, or member products.

In domain engineering, the scope of the entire product line is analyzed and its common and variable features are identified, which are then documented in a variability model. That is typically a feature diagram.
In parallel, a common design that represents all the possible combinations of features for all the possible variants is created. It is called a superset model, or a 150\% model, of the system, because it contains more information than what is needed for a specific product.
A link is then made between the feature diagram and certain points in the design (they are called variation points) that need to vary depending on the feature selection.

Application engineering is the process of deriving a single variant tailored to the requirements of a specific customer from a product line, based on the results of domain engineering. 
It means, that a product variant is defined by making specific feature choices. A design for a particular variant can then be produced by taking the design documents of the family and narrowing it down according to the feature choices.


\section{Case study}
\label{sec:case-study}

In this third chapter we introduce the case study, which we have prepared for testing the viability of digital LEGO for product line engineering education.
In the following, we first provide an overview of the selected product line and its product variants in Section~\ref{sec:product-variants}.
Then, we introduce the atomic modules of the product line, from with the individual variants have been assembled in Section~\ref{sec:atomic-modules}.
Finally, we explain the configuration options of the drone use case in the form of a feature tree model in Section~\ref{sec:configuration-options}.

\subsection{Product variants}
\label{sec:product-variants}

\cref{fig:product-variants} provides an overview of the product variants for the drone use case.
The use case comprises three product variants, an ultra-light drone (see \cref{fig:ultra-light}), a free-style drone (see \cref{fig:free-style}), and a long-range drone (see \cref{fig:long-range}).

\begin{description}
    \item[Ultralight drones] designed to comply with regulations by being exceptionally lightweight and compact.
    \item[Freestyle drones] optimized for agility, maneuverability, and creative flight in open environments with a focus on durability for performing aerial acrobatics and complex maneuvers.
    \item[Long-range drones] built for extended flight distances, featuring stable flight characteristics and efficient power consumption.

\subsection{Atomic modules}
\label{sec:atomic-modules}

Each drone is made up of four modules, that deliver a certain function. 
Each module has its own variants, which makes it possible to offer a greater variety of products.

\subsubsection{Propellors}
\label{sec:propellors}

Propellers generate thrust by spinning rapidly, allowing a drone to move in all directions. 
A two-blade propeller provides better efficiency and longer flight times, while a triblade propeller offers more stability and maneuverability. 
Smaller propellers provide better agility, while bigger ones provide more thrust and efficiency, allowing the drone fly longer distances. 
However, larger propellers also require more power to spin.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    }
    \caption{Overview of the propeller modules.}
    \label{fig:propeller}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Batteries}
\label{sec:batteries}

A battery provides power for the drone to operate. 
A smaller capacity battery is lighter and more compact, which can improve the agility and maneuverability of the drone. 
However, smaller batteries have shorter flight times, which means that for longer flights a higher capacity battery is more suitable.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \subcaptionbox{Small size\label{fig:battery-small}}{
        \includegraphics[height=1cm]{./drone-case-modules-battery-small.jpg}

    }
    \caption{Overview of the battery modules.}
    \label{fig:batteries}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Frames}
\label{sec:frames}

Frames serve as the structure that holds all the other parts together. 
A small frame is more maneuverable and agile, while a large frame offers more space for additional components (e.g. larger batteries).

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \subcaptionbox{Small frame\label{fig:frame-small}}{
        \includegraphics[height=2.1cm]{./SmallFrame.jpg}
    }
    \hfill

        \includegraphics[height=2.1cm]{./LargeFrame.jpg}
    }

    \caption{Overview of the frame modules.}
    \label{fig:frames}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Covers}
\label{sec:covers}

Covers protect internal components of the drone, help to improve aerodynamics and serve an aesthetic purpose as well.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    
    \subcaptionbox{Small cover\label{fig:cover-small}}{
        \includegraphics[height=2.1cm]{./drone-case-modules-cover-small.jpg}

    \hfill
    \subcaptionbox{Large cover\label{fig:cover-large}}{
        \includegraphics[height=2.1cm]{./drone-case-modules-cover-large.jpg}
    }
    \caption{Overview of the cover modules.}
    \label{fig:atomic-modules}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Configuration options}
\label{sec:configuration-options}

TODO \cref{fig:feature-tree}

\begin{figure*}[htbp]
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{./FeatureTreeWithLegend3.jpg}
    \caption{Overview of the configuration options for the drone use case.}
    \label{fig:feature-tree}
\end{figure*}

The modules can be combined to design customized end products.  For that purpose, the FPV drone variability model is developed. 
When a customer wishes to design and buy a drone, multiple decisions have to be made before the final system can be build. 
Figure 3 shows that the variation points Propeller, Battery, Frame and Cover have a mandatory dependency with the FPV drone, which means that they have to be included in the final product. 
For each of these variation points a variant has to be selected. The variants are connected by an alternative choice dependency with a minimum and maximum equal to one, which means that only one variant has to be chosen to be included to the final product. 
Additionally, two types of constraint dependencies exist: require constraint and exclude constraint. The require constraint means that when the small frame is selected, the small cover should be integrated to the system, and when the large frame is selected, the large cover should be integrated. 
The excluding constraint means that when a large propeller is selected, the small frame can not be integrated to the design and this relationship goes the other way round as well.

\subsubsection{Interface constraints}

Physical interfaces between interacting modules enable their geometric connection. A frame for the drone example has three interfaces: with a battery, with propellers and with a cover. 
However, several geometrical constraints should be considered. These include:

\begin{description}
    \item[Size and shape constraints] Modules must be designed in such a way that they can physically fit together without interference. 
For the drone example, the large frame can accommodate all three types of batteries, while the small frame is limited to only small and medium batteries because of the size constraints.
    \item[Alignment constraints] Modules must be aligned properly to ensure proper functioning when assembled together. 
For example, covers must be oriented correctly relative to frames to serve the protective and aesthetic purposes. 
    \item[Interference constraints] It is important to consider potential interferences between modules, such as conflicting shapes or components that may impede proper assembly or operation. 
It is technically feasible to install any propeller on any frame, but practical constraints come into play. For instance, a large propeller cannot be mounted on a small frame without interference, as it would collide with the frame during rotation.
These geometric restrictions cause constraint dependencies that are shown in Figure 3.
\end{description}

\subsection{150\% model}
\label{sec:150-model}

The case study demonstrates the utilization of digital LEGOs to create a 150\% model of a 3D drone architecture. 
This model is build in LeoCAD, a program that adheres to the LDraw standard. 
Within the structure of the LDraw file, a main document serves as the foundation where all three variants of the drone are instantiated. 
Each variant is further segmented into submodels, which consist of modular components. 
These modules are essentially instances of the submodels, all organized within the same file.

The approach enables to reuse the modules and submodels, promoting efficiency and versatility in design. 
The 150\% model encompasses all feasible combinations of drone features across the different variants. 
This abundance of information extends beyond the actual requirements of a specific drone type; for instance, showcasing three distinct battery sizes even though a practical FPV drone would only utilize one.
